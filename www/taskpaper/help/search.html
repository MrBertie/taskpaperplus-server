Search Cheatsheet
======
All of following syntax can be used in searches, in any order.
You only need to type as much of the word as necessary for it to be recognised:

E.g. "=tom" is enough to search for "=tomorrow"
    

Simple
------
- Word            `harry`
- Multiple words  `harry roof fall`
- Exclude words   `harry -roof`
- Phrases         `"harry fell off roof"`
- Or search       `harry | roof`
- Simple date     `=24-Jul-2009`
- Before/after    `<24-jul-2010 >24-Jul-2010`
- Date range      `24-jul-2009..24-aug-2009`
- Tags            `#harry`

Intervals `=`
------
- Yesterday   `=yesterday`
- Today       `=today >today <today`
- Tomorrow    `=tomorrow`
- Day         `=day =2day =10day`
- Week        `=week =2week`
- Month       `=month =6month`
- Year        `=year >year <year`
- Past        `=past`
- Future      `=future`

*NOTE: Day, week, month, year, all accept a number before the word (no spaces!), meaning the number of intervals*

States `*`
------
- Todo    `*todo`
- Next    `*next`
- Wait    `*wait`
- Maybe   `*maybe`
- Done    `*done`

Filters `#`
------
- Next    `#next`
- Soon    `#soon`
- Wait    `#wait`
- Maybe   `#maybe`
- Todo    `#todo`
- Done    `#done`
- Due     `#due`

Sorting `/ \`
------
- Task        `/task \task`
- Late        `#late`
- State       `/state \state`
- Date        `/date \date`
- Project     `/project \project`
- Multiple    `#harry \date`
- Multiple    `=week | *next \date`

*NOTE:*

- `/` means search "ascending (a-z, or dates going up)
- `\` means "descending" (z-a, dates going down)

**Happy searching!**
