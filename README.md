Taskpaper+ with portable, local, webserver
======

Double-click the `start-nginx.exe` program to start.  A new window should open.  Use the `Start` button to get your server going.  Then navigate to `http://localhost/taskpaper` in your browser.

**NOTE** : Taskpaper+ only works corectly in Firefox, Chrome or Opera, NOT Internet Explorer.  Sorry about that but it's not likely to change soon...
