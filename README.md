Taskpaper+ with webserver
------

Taskpaper+ bundled together with a portable, local, webserver.
Double-click the `start-nginx.exe` program to start.  A new window should open.  Then use the `Start` button to get your server going.  Finally navigate to `http://localhost/taskpaper` in your browser to start using Taskpaper+.

**NOTE** : Taskpaper+ only works corectly in Firefox, Chrome, or Opera, NOT Internet Explorer.  Sorry about that but it's not likely to change soon...
